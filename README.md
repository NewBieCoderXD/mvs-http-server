# MVS HTTP & Websocket Server

Will add more stuff soon.

The routes are auto generated by parsing a postman collection from [MVS-DUMP](https://github.com/multiversuskoth/mvs-dump). I will share the code that transforms the postmancollectio.json and combines it with the catalog folder.

A lot to do but main things I will be adding
Express Middleware to handle common hydra headers, middleware to inject connection mongo
